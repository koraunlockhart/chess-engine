# chess-engine
c++ chess engine

## What is this ?
this is my attempt at a chess engine written in c++ like the ones seen in Sebastian Lague's small token competition.

## Will this be a Small Token Engine
no, as this is my first engine, it will simpy be a chess engine. however, there will likely be an attempt at a small engine eventually.

## Are there any outside resources you're going to use ?
yes. i'm going to make use of the chess engine wiki, following the steps to at least guide my attempts to build a workable engine.

### house keeping.
this program will mostly be written in c++, however i recognize that sebastian's was written in c#. i'm unsure as to whether that will change how i
need to write my program, as the gui and interfaces he used may be incompatible. i don't know how stockfish is written for example either.
